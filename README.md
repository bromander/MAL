  Program that allows you to open minecraft assets view and download them

## For what?
Are you looking for a specific sound but canâ€™t find it online? Or are you a resource pack developer unsure which folder contains the game menu background? This program was created just for that!

## Where can I find the indexes?
You can find the indexes at:
C:\Users\(UserName)\AppData\Roaming\.minecraft\assets\indexes
If Minecraft is installed in a different folder look for the indexes there
